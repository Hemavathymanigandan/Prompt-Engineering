## ALOGORITHM:

Step 1: Define the main theme — a bat who is afraid of the dark.
Step 2: Identify the target audience (children aged 5–7) to ensure the story is simple, engaging, and safe.
Step 3: Structure the story with a clear beginning (introduction of the bat), middle (conflict/challenge), and end (resolution and happy conclusion).
Step 4: Use prompt-engineering techniques to guide the AI into producing creative, child-friendly, and bedtime-appropriate output.
Step 5: Review and refine the generated story for clarity, flow, and suitability for the target age group.
